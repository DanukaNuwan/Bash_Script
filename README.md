# Bash_Script

I developed a Bash script that can scan any URL or IP address for open ports and 
vulnerabilities. I got the idea for this Bash script from the TryHackMe website. I 
found a room on the website that provided knowledge about basic Bash scripting. 
I used multiple security tools.  
• Amass – amass is information gathering tool. It can help in discovering 
subdomains, IP addresses using techniques like DNS enumeration. 
• Nmap – Nmap is open-source network scanning tool. It is used to discover 
open ports and gather information about these tools. 
• Nikto – nikto is popular web vulnerability scan tool. It is used to identify 
security vulnerabilities in web servers and web applications. 
• Droopescan – Droopescan is python-based tool designed to scan websites 
which used WordPress, Joomla.  
• theHarvester – Harvester is information gathering tool used to gather email 
addresses, sub domains, host, employee names. 
• SSLyze - SSLyze is a Python tool used to analyze the SSL/TLS configurations of 
remote servers. It checks for common vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and 
potential weaknesses. 
• Dnsenum - nsenum is a command-line tool used to gather information about 
DNS (Domain Name System) from a target domain. It can discover 
subdomains, DNS records, and perform other DNS-related tasks. 
• Wapiti - Wapiti is an open-source web application vulnerability scanner. It is 
designed to identify security issues in web applications, including SQL 
injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) 
• OpenVAS - OpenVAS is a vulnerability scanning and management platform. It 
helps organizations identify and manage vulnerabilities in their networks and 
systems.
